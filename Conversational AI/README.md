## Architecture

The system uses three specialized agents:

1. **Research Analyst**: Identifies competitors, analyzes market positioning, and studies foot traffic patterns
2. **Strategy Consultant**: Develops competitive strategies and identifies market opportunities
3. **Report Compiler**: Creates professional, formatted reports with actionable insights

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key
- Internet connection for API access

## Installation

```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get your Gemini API key:
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key for use in the application

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run competitor_analysis_agentic.py
```

2. Configure the analysis in the sidebar:
   - Enter your Gemini API key
   - Specify the location (e.g., "Koramangala, Bangalore")
   - Set the number of competitors to analyze (3-10)
   - Choose detail level (Summary, Detailed, Comprehensive)

- Handles deepcopy issues with custom reply functions
- Manages conversation state across agents

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Ensure your Gemini API key is valid and has sufficient quota
2. **Location Not Found**: Use specific, well-known location names
3. **Slow Response**: Large competitor counts may take longer to process
4. **Report Not Generated**: Check the conversation log for agent errors

### Error Messages

- "Analysis error": Check internet connection and API key validity
- "Final report not found": The system will show the full conversation instead

## Limitations

- Requires active internet connection for API calls

- Real-time data may not be available for all locations
- API rate limits may affect large analyses

## Security Notes

- API keys are handled securely (password field in UI)
- No data is stored locally
- All analysis is performed via Google's secure APIs
